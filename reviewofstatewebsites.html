    <h1>The Five State Websites</h1>

    <h1><a href="https://alaska.gov/">Alaska</a></h1>
    <p>Alaska's homepage is definitely an eye catcher, with its unique blue background and yellow borders. Flicking through the different tabs such as "Home", each different subcategory seems to be loading in a relatively quick time. Obviously it could be faster, but it is definitely not slow. Additionally, the menu itself is adequate but nothing special. There are the five tabs available to click on (Home, Resident, Business, Visitor, and State Employees) as well as options further down the page such as "Services", "My Government", "Public Notices", "Kids Corner", and "Connect With Us". As for finding items easily on the website, I see it as pretty straightforward. To me, it does not appear confusing but rather simple and straight to the point, with different tabs offering explanations and information. However, when I adjust my screen size with the website open, the website does not follow those adjustments I made. Instead, it just makes me see only a portion of the website, so when I click on a tab that is in the corner of my adjusted screen, I cannot see all the options it lays out for me. I have to manually move my mouse to make the vision move over the website, which is annoying to continuously do.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://www.iowa.gov/">Iowa</a></h1>
    <p>Immediately when I open up Iowa's website, I see a major problem with it. This may just be my own opinion, but I do not like how zoomed in it appears, and how massive all the fonts and buttons are. Looking back at Alaska's website, there is a nice clean border of navy blue around all the information, which keeps a clean look that is formal. With Iowa, everything is spread out across the whole screen and is just massive. They utilize the whole space they have, which does not always mean better. I keep wanting to zoom out to see more, but I can not which infuriates me. As for load times, the Iowa website seems to be on the slower end. Compared to Alaska, Iowa is definitely a lot slower as it has more colors and images to load with each page. For example, clicking on "Starting a Business" under "Business" takes about three seconds to load, compared to Alaska which takes about 1 second. Moving on, while the menu on Iowa is a neat and cool design with different symbols and colors representing different options, I still feel it needs to be a little smaller. Again, everything is too large on the screen, and I feel as if I am zoomed in way too far. Finding items on the website can get a little confusing as lots of scrolling and tab clicking is involved to navigate to other pages. However, when viewing iowa.gov on my mobile phone, the website is a lot more streamline with its information. It is still too zoomed in, but the information is more in order and listlike as I scroll down my mobile phone, which is much nicer.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://oklahoma.gov/">Oklahoma</a></h1>
    <p>When I opened up Oklahoma's website for the fist time, I immediately said to myself "It's got the same problem as Iowa's website!" It feels too zoomed in, and takes up the whole screen. Going back to Alaska, there is a nice blue border around all the information, whereas on the Oklahoma page there is no border like Alaska's, just information spread across the whole page. Loading times appear to be average for me. Not the slowest, but also not the quickest. This might depend on what links I click and so on, but it seems adequate for me. As for a menu, well... it does not appear to really have a menu like the previous two websites. All Oklahoma has is just "Popular Resources" and "Stay Connected". While I do think that a simplistic design is better than a comples design, too simplistic is not great. There needs to at least be a bar with different links or tabs on it to navigate through information. Oklahoma does not have any of that, only a "Search" bar at the top. Finding things on the website does not really seem to be an issue as there is nothing really to find on it, as it is a very simplistic design with links and photos. As for working on adjusted screen sizes, the website does the same thing the Alaska website does. When I shrink the page, it does not shrink with it, only my view of the page shrinks. Therefore, if I want to move around the page I have to scroll in every direction to see all of it, which is tedious.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://www.tn.gov/">Tennessee</a></h1>
    <p>I am actually pleasantly surprised by the Tennessee website. While there is not a border around the edges like the Alaska website, Tennessee found a way to make it work and look visually appealing. The three colors red, while, and blue all work in tandem with each other to make a good looking page that does not overbear the viewer upon first glance. It has many images, a font size that is not massive, and a format that is pleasing. However, the Tennessee website appears to be the slowest loading website so far, and I imagine that has to do with the multitude of images on the website. Even though it is slow, I am not bothered by it since the website looks great and tidy. Additionally, the menu is straightforward. Located at the top of the page, there are many different buttons to click and select, along wiht many tabs that pop up underneath when hovering over a button. Since the layout is very streamline and tidy, navigating the page is fairly easy and not too bothersome. When pulling it up on my mobile phone, it still works well and is very streamline. All the images are in a vertical line, with information following them right underneath.</p>

    <h1><a href="https://www.vermont.gov/#gsc.tab=0">Vermont</a></h1>
    <p>As I scroll down looking at Vermont's website, I am immediately reminded of Iowa's website as they run into a similar problem that I am not a fan of. They both are zoomed in too far, and do not have a border around the edges like Alaska's website. Everything is too stretched out wide, especially the images. On the otherhand, I do enjoy the colors Vermont chose to use, specifically the green. Green is one of my favorite colors, so seeing it pop up when I hover over words and buttons is a nice touch. When clicking on different tabs and buttons, the load times seem to be adequate. Again, they are definitely not the quickest, but they are also definitely not the slowest. Furthermore, the menu is easy to navigate. Located at the top of the screen, I can choose what topic I want to click on, and then choose a sub topic to pick from there. It is also kind of cool that the search bar is smack in the middle of the page when you load it up, almost pressuring you or wanting you to search something up about Vermont. Finding items on the website is fine, it just takes a lot of scrolling up and down since the page is so zoomed in. Obviously could be better, but it will do for the time being. One interesting thing I did notice was when I minimized the page, the website minimized with it. Instead of like the previous websites where they stick to their original format, Vermont's page adapts to my screen, staying true to the size I make the tab. This is the only website out of these five that I have seen do that, so props to Vermont for making this possible.</p>

    <h1>Rankings</h1>
    <p>Looking back at the five websites, I have come to a concrete ranking based on my experiences with them.</p>
    <ul>1. Tennessee</ul>
    <ul>2. Alaska</ul>
    <ul>3. Vermont</ul>
    <ul>4. Oklahoma</ul>
    <ul>5. Iowa</ul>
    <p>Tennessee comes in at number one with no surprises. It utilized colors well, kept a tidy format, was not too zoomed in, and was fine on a mobile device. Alaska follows in second place as it had a clean border keeping all the information in line, its menu box at the top of the screen was easy to use and navigate, and it was not zoomed in. In third, Vermont claims the position. Although the website was zoomed in, the green color and the website adapting to a minimized form when I minimized the screen was admirable. Next, Oklahoma comes in at fourth. It had barely any information or tabs/buttons, was zoomed in, and was rather boring to look at overall. Finally, Iowa comes in at last with the number five rank. I just can not stand how zoomed in it is, and how big the font sizes are. There is too much clicking on all the buttons to open up the tabs with them, and it takes a super long time to load the page and other pages within the Iowa website.</p>
