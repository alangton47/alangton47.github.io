            <h1>Winter!</h1>
            <p>Winter occurs from late December to late March. Generally, winter is the coldest season, as the Earth is tilted the farthest away from the sun. Due to the weather being so cold, winter is often full of snow and ice, depending on the location. In mountainous places specifically, snow and ice will form. During this time, winter sports such as skiing and snowboarding are at an all time high, while the snow is fresh. While many go out and enjoy the snow, others prefer staying indoors next to the fire drinking hot cocoa. Holidays that occur in winter include Christmas, New Year, and Valentine's Day.</p>
