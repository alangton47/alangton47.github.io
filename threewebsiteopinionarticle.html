    <h1>Three Website Opinion Article: Two Good, One Bad</h1>

    <p>The <a href="https://www.tesla.com/">Tesla</a> website is a prime example of how to get the most out of a simplistic design. For example, the home page of Tesla is literally 7 images of their products along with some text added to the top and bottom of the page. When I imagine the web designers creating this website, I imagine them wanting something that was not confusing for the user, something that was simple yet also sleek and straightforward. Additionally, the color usage is very basic, yet so effective. Again on the home page, the backgrounds of the images are all a majority of gray/white, with the center of the image (the product) being a bright and vibrant color such as red, blue, or white. By using these bright and vibrant colors, the eyes are immediately drawn towards the product, which is exactly what Tesla wants. The same could be said about the "Shop" page, where there is a giant and vibrant yellow "Tesla Tequila" bottle surrounded by a black backgorund smack in the middle of the page. The yellow grabs the attention of your eyes before anything else. While inspecting the page elements, I recognized not all, but most of the HTML elements, "div", "script", "noscript", "body", "head", "main", "a", "section", "ul", "footer", "dialog", and "html". There was one part that had about 7 "divs" all stacked ontop of one another with no text, so it looked very strange. Other than that, the coding appears to be in order and very well done. Navigating around the website is very straightforward in my opinion, as it is laid out very simplistic with the tool bar at the top, and other options as you scroll down the website. On certain parts of the website, there are scrolling effects. For example, on the Roadster and Semi pages, images and videos will appear as you scroll over them. Instead of just being there, they will appear as you look at them which is very stylish. One little thing I noticed that sets this website apart is the automatic scrolling. If you scroll halfway through an image and let go, it will continue to scroll down automatically until the image is completely filling the screen. It does not seem like much, but it adds a nice touch to it even if it is practically meaningless. Overall, I very much like this website. From its simplistic/minimalist use of colors, buttons, HTML elements, and little things, the web designers at Tesla did a remarkable job. This simplistic design sets it apart from other websites, specifically Craiglist, which will be covered later. </p>

    <p><a href="https://portlandgear.com/">Portland Gear</a> is a small local clothing business in downtown Portland. While they are just a small business, their website is one of the nicest I have ever seen. I imagine when the web designers were creating the webpage they wanted it to stand out and not be like the bigger clothing brands. They wanted it to be different, "weird", unique like the city of Portland itself. Its use of colors, images, and easy to navigate buttons really make it stand out from bigger clothing competitors. Looking at the page elements while inspecting, it seems a very smooth and understandable layout. Like Tesla, it uses "div", "script", "noscript", "body", "head", "main", "a", "section", "style", "img", "dialog", and "html". Because of this, the layout is easy to make sense of. A tool bar up top with their newest clothing right below, followed by three buttons to their main products, a brief statement about who they are, and then wrapped up with images of some of their newest/classic products. There is a hardly noticeable scrolling effect when passing the "Who We Are" section where the image will move over when the user scrolls over it, but that is about it. Actually navigating the website is pretty easy to do. Everything is clearly labeled with text, and the buttons really stand out. Going back to colors, the website does a fantastic job of using a lot, but not overwhelming the user. On the home page alone, I counted around 10 colors being used in background, images, logos, etc. Similar to Tesla, Portland Gear makes sure to get the important items a bright and vibrant color to make sure the attention of the user is directed to that color The background is white, yet all of their products are colors. On the homepage, when scrolling down to the "Portland Inspired Stickers", all four of them have a special background color such as gray, purple, yellow, and red. These draw the attention of the user as the colors pop out when scrolled over. Additionally, a lot of the colors match their products and audiences. For one, the company is really known for their colorful hats with the letter "P", and these colors go with some of those hats. A little thing I noticed that sets this website apart is the use of white space and the columns. In my opinion, the home page is split into three columns, with a few exceptions in some sections. Additionally, everything is not all cramped/smooshed together, as it is spaced out well with white space between images and sections. If everything was cramped/smooshed together, the page may appear to overwhelming for a lot of users.</p>

    <p>Last but not least is <a href="https://craigslist.org/">Craigslist</a>. Craigslist is renowned for having an awful webpage, is one that just makes the user want to avert their eyes immediately. When the web designers were making this website, I imagine them being two minimum wage designers who really do not care at all about putting in effort, so they just stuck with a barebone design that would get the job done, and only get the job done. I very much dislike this website due to the lack of color, images, and text. It is just a bland page to look at that has too much information on it. While inspecting the elements of the page, I noticed that it is a lot smaller compared to the previous two sites. This is most likely due to the simple format and lack of images. Craigslist uses "html", "head", "body", "script", "div", "ul", "span" and "iframe". As for the layout, all that it is, is 5 major columns with way too many imbedded links in the text. Around 98% of all the text on this page is imbedded with a link. While some may find it easy to navigate since everything is right there and no scrolling is needed, I find it very confusing and overwhemling. There is simply too much text to look at and too much to choose from. It all needs to be spaced out and separated into different sections of the webpage. If the user was an elderly person, all the text would appear as out of focus hieroglyphics, because there is just way too much happening. Furthermore, it is absured that the web designers could not even bother with capitalizing a single word on the webpage. Everything is in lowercase, and makes me twitch at how ugly it looks. Regarding color, Craigslist uses gray, white, and blue, with a hint of yellow here and there. There are no images to add color, so all of it is through background and text. Because of this, the only thing that really stood out to me was the text as it is a brighter blue, but other than that nothing grabs my attention. However, their use of colors does match their products in my opinion, as all the products are bland and boring, just like the website. As for little things, there is literally nothing I can think of. Craiglist does not even use a cool icon for their logo, it is just "craigslist". It is probably the most basic/simplistic/minimalist website I have ever visited. Tesla is a good example of simplicity/minimalism, while Craigslist is a bad example of simplicity/minimalism. </p>
